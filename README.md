# credit-scoring-model

A machine learning project to predict credit risk and assess a loan applicant's creditworthiness based on their financial history. This model is built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and trained on a dataset of loan applicant information.

## üìù Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify loan applicants as either "good" or "bad" credit risks. By analyzing historical loan data, the model learns patterns that help in making automated and data-driven decisions, reducing the risk of loan defaults. This is a common and critical task for financial institutions.

## üíæ Dataset

The model is trained on the `loan_data_1248_with_missing.csv` dataset. This file contains various attributes for each loan applicant, which may include:

-   Demographic information (e.g., age, income)
-   Loan-specific details (e.g., loan amount, purpose)
-   Historical financial data (e.g., existing debts, past defaults)

As the filename suggests, this dataset contains missing values, and a key part of the project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data before training the model.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries:

-   **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
-   **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
-   **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
-   **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the project notebook.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    You can install the necessary packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

## Usage

To run the project and see the analysis, launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook credit_scoring_model.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## üî¨ Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration**: The `loan_data_1248_with_missing.csv` dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the variables.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and the data is scaled to prepare it for modeling.
3.  **Feature Engineering**: New features may be created from existing ones to improve model performance.
4.  **Model Training**: A classification model (such as Logistic Regression, a Decision Tree, or a Random Forest) is trained on the preprocessed data.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve to determine its effectiveness in predicting credit risk.
